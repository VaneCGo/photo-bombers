#Photo Bombers

A simple app that uses Instagram API. It basically displays photos given a **hashtag**. My favourite hashtag is Taylor Swift, but you can change it to whatever you want. Change it to Beyonc√©, for example :wink:.

A few things to consider:
* Don't forget to add your `client_id` and `SimpleAuthRedirectURIKey` in the `AppDelegate.m` file.
* I use `NSUserDefaults` to store the accessToken, well, **NEVER** do this in production apps! Use **keychain** instead :smile_cat:.

I created this app following a Treehouse tutorial.

Have fun! :sunglasses:
